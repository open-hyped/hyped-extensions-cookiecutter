# Cookiecutter Hyped Extension

A **Cookiecutter template** for creating `hyped` extensions. Extensions are optional add-ons that expand the core functionality of `hyped` by providing specialized nodes and operations for various use cases. This template provides a ready-to-use package structure that integrates with `hyped`.

## Features

- **Organized Structure**: Creates a modular, maintainable package structure.
- **Documentation Ready**: Includes basix setup for sphinx-style project documentation.
- **Testing Framework**: Prepares a folder for unit tests.
- **CI/CD Support**: Adds GitHub Actions workflows for automation (coming soon).

## Creating an extension repository

Here’s how to create an extension:

```bash
# install cookiecutter
pip install cookiecutter
# create repository from template
cookiecutter gh:open-hyped/hyped.extensions.cookiecutter
```

A directory of the following structure will be generated in the current directory:

```python
hyped.extensions.<NAME>
├── README.md                      # Description of your extension
├── pyproject.toml                 # Build system and dependency management
├── src/hyped/extensions/<NAME>    # Your extension package
│   ├── __init__.py                # Initializes the package
│   ├── nodes                      # Directory for hyped nodes
│   │   ├── __init__.py            # Initializes the nodes module
│   │   └── dummy.py               # Example processor implementation
│   └── ops                        # Directory for high-level operations
│       └── __init__.py            # Initializes the operations module
├── docs/                          # Basic Sphinx documentation setup
│   ├── build.sh                   # Builds the documentation
│   └── source/                    # Sphinx source directory
├── tests/hyped/extensions/<NAME>  # Unit tests for the extension
│   ├── __init__.py                # Initializes the test module
│   └── test_dummy.py              # Tests for the example processor
└── .github/workflows/             # GitHub Actions workflows (coming soon)
```

**Note**: The `src/hyped/extensions` directory is part of the `hyped.extensions` namespace. Do not add any files or folders directly in `src/hyped/extensions` (i.e., outside `<NAME>`). Doing so would break the namespace and could lead to import errors.

For example, the following structure is **invalid** and would cause issues:

```python
src/hyped/extensions/
├── my_extension/    # Valid
├── utils.py         # Invalid: Breaks the namespace
└── helpers/         # Invalid: Breaks the namespace
```

Instead, ensure all your extension's code is contained entirely within the `src/hyped/extensions/<NAME>` folder.


## Namespace Behavior

The hyped.extensions namespace relies on a shared structure between the core hyped package and any installed extensions. Python’s namespace packages have specific rules for handling modules across multiple installations, which can lead to unexpected issues if these rules are not followed.

- **Development Mode** (`pip install -e`): When the core `hyped` package is installed in development mode, the namespace `hyped.extensions` behaves differently than when installed in regular mode.

- **Mixed Installation Modes**: If the core `hyped` package is installed in development mode and an extension is installed in regular (non-development) mode, the namespace behavior can break. Specifically, the extension may fail to register under the `hyped.extensions` namespace.


| Core hyped Installation | Extension Installation | Behavior |
|-------------------------|------------------------|:--------:|
| Development Mode (-e)   | Development Mode (-e)  |    Ok    |
| Development Mode (-e)   | Regular Mode           |   Error  |
| Regular Mode            | Development Mode (-e)  |    Ok    |
| Regular Mode            | Regular Mode           |    Ok    |

This issue arises because Python uses a combination of `sys.path` and `*.dist-info` metadata to resolve namespaces. In development mode, the `src` directory is added to the `sys.path` directly, which can conflict with extensions installed in non-development mode (e.g., as `.dist-info` or `.egg-info`). This conflict prevents Python from correctly recognizing the namespace for extensions.

**Note**: This behavior is not specific to `hyped` but is a general limitation of Python’s namespace package system when mixing development and non-development installation modes.
